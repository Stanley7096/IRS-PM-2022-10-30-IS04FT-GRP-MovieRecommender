## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Nowadays movies have become one of the most popular and crucial entertainment mediums in people’s daily life. Also as a popular culture and art in contemporary society, the penetration, inclusiveness and coverage of movie and television art are unmatched by other arts. It affects social life by acting on people's thoughts and concepts. Movie and television appreciation can improve the aesthetic taste and artistic appreciation ability of people all around the world, and plays an important role in the quality education of people.

With the rapid development of Internet and technology, more and more companies tend to build an online movie website by purchasing movies’ copyright and provide users with paid online viewing services like Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, Tencent Video, etc. And every platform has its own recommendation system, which is very significant:

First, a fast recommendation system can increase user growth, increase user retention, activity, and length of stay on the web pages.

Most video streaming platforms use the membership-based profit model, Therefore, it is very important to increase the conversion rate of VIP and VIP retention. An accurate recommendation system can increase the purchase rate of VIP and attract users to continue watching movies that match their preferences.

A complete recommendation system can help save labor costs for companies. We can imagine that, with the increase of business complexity, the cost of the algorithm is basically constant, while the editing cost increases linearly. Therefore, the recommendation algorithm is widely used in extremely complex products or video companies with multiple product matrices to maintain, which can greatly reduce the Labor costs.

Using the techniques imparted to us in lectures, Our group use MySQL for building the whole database and deploy Django to build interfaces, and use python post method to resolve user preference data sent back by the frontend(Jquery+CSS3+HTML5). The collaborative filtering algorithm written by Python will give a feedback recommendation result back to the frontend.
